## Description
For our project me and Paul made a container moving robot arm. We decided to use a cylindrical arm for its compactibility, simplicity, and 360 degrees of motion. It can move containers up, down, and 360 degrees to pick them up and put them down. This project utilizes my CAD skills and Paul's code skills.

## Problem to solve 
Human inabillity to move heavy objects like a shipping crate efficiently.

## Smart Goal
By February 31st we will have built a Robot arm that can move a minature shippng container in 3 different axis of motion. When me and Paul move the potentiometers it will go up or down and when we press the button the claw will grab.
