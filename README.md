## Description
For our project me and Paul made a container moving robot arm. We decided to use a cylindrical arm for its compactibility, simplicity, and 360 degrees of motion. It can move containers up, down, and 360 degrees to pick them up and put them down. This project utilizes my CAD skills and Paul's code skills.

## Problem to solve 
Human inabillity to move heavy objects like a shipping crate efficiently.

## Smart Goal
By March 10th we will have built a Robot arm that can move a minature shippng container in 3 different axis of motion. When me and Paul move the potentiometers it will go up or down and when we press the button the claw will grab.

## Orginal sketch designs

The top design was our earliest concept of the arm. We knew we wanted to do it so we were coming up with ideas of the claw and the moving base. We changed the claw from the top picture for simplicity but the design of the arm remained similar. The base (lower left) we stuck with, cleaning up the design a little, and for the model (bottom right) we had the same system of a screw motor, arm, moving base, but the thing we modified was the holder at the base of the arm to save materials.

For the bottom design its much cleaner and we had a better pictre in our head of what we wanted it to look like. The design pretty much stayed the same as the bottom picture with only slight adjustments. One major change was the Arm shaft design turned into 2 pillars without a grove to save time and materials. 

### Criteria
- Be able to lift a crate
- rotate 360 degrees
- Materials: Acrylic, Arduino, Plastic (3D print), Arduino sheild, thick acrylic, Stepper motor, Servo motors, worm screw, button, potentiometer

### Constraints
- Materials (especially not having metal part to connect screw to stepper)
- Time is a problem especially because of the time it takes to fabricate and also the designing proccess.
- The need for some sturdy parts (metal)

## Problems and solutions 
### Problem #1
-Friction fit joints not being tight enough to hold (especially for our project because its heavy) 
### Solution
- For the solution I asked Mr. H for help and he told me to apply a 0.16mm thicken on each side instead of 0.8 which wasn't working for me the first time
- *side note* the thick acrylic isn't 6.36mm it's more like 5.2mm for something to consider in friction fitting and for design in general.

### Problem #2
- The use of single screws as joints for T-slots so it acts as a rotating joint and creating a less strudy part
- [example image]
### Solution
- I mostly had to reprint parts to include 2 screws to limit movement so I wish I had thought of it earlier. 
### Problem #3 
- This only happened to me once but to make sure to account for nuts and bolts (the nuts were a bigger problem for me)
### solution
- make an assembly and put all the nuts and bolts in their places to see if any parts need to be adjusted.

## Planning

This is our planning document from the beggining of the year. This planning shows how long projects can take and the importance of time management. For the research we completed on time and had little difficulty since we already had a good idea in our heads of what we wanted for our project. For the design I was way off in predicting to be done in January; I finished some time around now (March 5th-7th) just hammering our all the small errors near the end while having the frame and main parts in place by Febuary 10th-15th. For the manufacutring, I misjudged again, and we finished this around march 9th to 10th cutting the deadline close. For the code, we were off again, Paul did a good job of completing the code but finished a little later because of some problems and tangents but finished around March 3rd-6th. The takeaway from this information is to show the importance of planning and to make timely and realistic goals to not fall behind. Another thing is to focus on your goals because sometimes engineering can be easy to push off during the schiool year until the last minute so to stick to goals is to succeed
